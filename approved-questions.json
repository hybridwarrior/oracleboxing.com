      "question": "What makes combinations more effective than throwing single punches?",
      "context": "",
      "explanation": "The key to effective combinations is the continuous rotation from left to right (and right to left). As Jordan explains: 'Every single punch links into the next one... the jab is what starts it all and that's coming from this position to this position. This bit of rotation can turn my body through nearly 180 degrees to line up my cross.' Each punch naturally flows into the next when you maintain this rotational axis.",

      "explanation": "Telegraphing happens when you give visual cues before the punch: pulling the hand back, tensing the shoulder, or doing a 'bow and arrow' motion.

      "context": "",
      "explanation": "The CATCH is performed by turning your rear hand outward to meet an incoming jab with a little pressure. It's specifically effective against jabs because they carry less power. Unlike a parry which redirects the punch, the catch stops it in place. Your catch hand mirrors the opponent's punch side.",

      "context": "",
      "explanation": "The PARRY redirects punches off-course rather than stopping them. This is crucial for power shots like the cross - just turning your hand (catch) won't stop a hard cross from getting through. With a parry, you rotate slightly and tap the punch aside, taking it off course. This also leaves the opponent off-balance and open for counters. Catches work for jabs because they carry less power.",

      "context": "",
      "explanation": "Body shot defense relies on your ELBOWS covering your liver and spleen - not your hands. Key adjustments: (1) Keep elbows tucked tight against your body, (2) Concave your stomach inward to make a smaller target, (3) Lean SLIGHTLY into incoming body shots so your elbow absorbs more impact. If elbows are flared out, you have to move them further to block. Good shape = easy body defense.",

      "context": "",
      "explanation": "When you bend at the waist instead of rotating your hips and using your legs, you shift your weight forward uncontrollably. This destroys your balance, makes it nearly impossible to return to guard quickly, and leaves you unable to throw effective counters. Proper slipping uses hip rotation with a slight shoulder dip while maintaining the 60% back foot weight distribution.",

      "context": "",
      "explanation": "When you slip a jab to the outside (your left vs an orthodox opponent), you move AWAY from their rear hand (the cross). If you slipped inside, you'd be moving directly into the path of their power punch. The same principle applies in reverse when slipping their cross - you slip to your right to avoid their follow-up jab.",

      "context": "",
      "explanation": "Punching power starts from the ground. By exerting force into the floor with your feet, you initiate the kinetic chain: the ground pushes back, allowing your hips to rotate, which stretches the fascia across your torso, whipping your shoulders and arm through. Your arm essentially 'snaps out by itself' from this chain reaction—the power comes from your core and legs, not from pushing with your arm muscles.",

      "context": "",
      "explanation": "The fix is rotation, starting from your back foot. Your spine is your axis of rotation—pivot on the ball of your back foot, which turns your knee, which turns your hip to face perpendicular to your opponent. This rotation should go through nearly 180 degrees (from side-on to facing forward). Keep your head still as the axis point while your body rotates around it. Without this hip rotation, you're just arm-punching and missing the entire kinetic chain.",
