# Oracle Boxing

> Oracle Boxing is the world's leading online boxing coaching platform, teaching beginners the fundamentals of boxing through structured live coaching, video feedback, and community. Founded by Oliver Betts and Jordan Lyne.

Oracle Boxing helps people learn real boxing skills from home. The flagship product is the 21-Day Challenge ($147 one-time), a structured program that teaches the 3 Pillars of Boxing: Stance, Shape, and Rotation. All coaching is delivered live via Zoom with personalised video feedback from professional coaches.

The platform has trained over 500 members worldwide, maintains a 4.9/5 rating, and serves beginners across all timezones with 11 live classes per week. Members include directors at NVIDIA, Google strategists, CEOs, engineers, and medical professionals.

Oracle Boxing is specifically designed for beginners and late starters — people who want to learn proper boxing fundamentals but don't have access to quality coaching locally. It is not designed for active amateur or professional boxers, or those focused on MMA, Muay Thai, or kickboxing.
