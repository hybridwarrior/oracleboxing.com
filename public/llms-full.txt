## About Oracle Boxing

Oracle Boxing is an online boxing coaching company that teaches real boxing fundamentals to beginners worldwide. Founded by Oliver Betts and Jordan Lyne, the platform was created to solve a common problem: most people don't have access to quality boxing coaching. Local gyms often lack structured teaching methodology, and many aspiring boxers are intimidated by the gym environment.

Oracle Boxing delivers professional boxing instruction via live Zoom coaching calls, personalised video feedback, structured curriculum, and a supportive global community. The platform has trained over 500 members and maintains a 4.9/5 satisfaction rating.

The company is based online and serves members across all timezones with 11 live coaching classes per week.

### 21-Day Challenge — $147 (One-Time Payment)

The 21-Day Challenge is Oracle Boxing's flagship entry product. It is a structured 21-day program designed to teach complete beginners the 3 Pillars of Boxing:

1. **Stance** — Proper boxing stance, footwork fundamentals, and balance.
2. **Shape** — Correct punching form, guard position, and defensive shape.
3. **Rotation** — Hip and shoulder rotation for power generation and efficient movement.

What's included in the 21-Day Challenge:

- Personalised video feedback on your technique from professional coaches
- Follow-along workout videos (Grade 1 curriculum)
- Access to the Oracle Boxing community

### Ongoing Membership (Invite-Only)

After completing the 21-Day Challenge, members are invited to join the ongoing membership. The membership is priced lower than the initial Challenge and provides:
- Continued access to live coaching calls
- Ongoing video feedback
- Progressive curriculum (higher Grades)
- Community access
- New content and drills

The membership is invite-only — you must complete the 21-Day Challenge first.

### 1-on-1 Coaching (Invite-Only)

For members who want dedicated personal attention, Oracle Boxing offers 1-on-1 coaching sessions. This is available by invitation only to existing members.

## Coaching Methodology

Oracle Boxing's coaching is structured around several key principles:

**Live Coaching Calls:** All coaching happens live on Zoom. This is not pre-recorded content. Coaches provide real-time instruction, correction, and feedback during each session. There are 11 live classes per week spread across timezones.

**Video Feedback:** Members record themselves practicing and submit videos. Coaches review each video individually and provide personalised technical feedback, pointing out what's working and what needs improvement.

**The 3 Pillars:** The curriculum is built around Stance, Shape, and Rotation — the three foundational elements that everything else in boxing builds upon. By mastering these fundamentals first, members develop correct habits from day one.

**Progressive Grade System:** The curriculum progresses through Grades. Grade 1 covers the absolute basics. Higher Grades build on the foundation with more advanced techniques, combinations, and skills.

**Research-Backed:** Oracle Boxing references peer-reviewed research on the physical and cognitive benefits of boxing training, including improvements in coordination, cardiovascular health, stress reduction, and cognitive function.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if I've never boxed before?**
Oracle Boxing is designed specifically for beginners. The 21-Day Challenge starts from absolute zero and builds progressively. No prior experience is needed.

**How does online boxing coaching work?**
You join live Zoom coaching calls where coaches demonstrate techniques and watch you practice in real time. Between calls, you record yourself practicing and submit videos for personalised feedback. The combination of live instruction and video review provides a level of individual attention that most in-person gyms can't match.

**What equipment do I need?**
You need minimal equipment to start — just enough space to move and a device to join Zoom calls and record yourself. Specific equipment recommendations are provided when you enrol.

**Is there a money-back guarantee?**
Yes. Oracle Boxing offers a money-back guarantee on the 21-Day Challenge. If you're not satisfied, you can request a refund.

**What happens after the 21-Day Challenge?**
After completing the Challenge, you'll be invited to join the ongoing membership at a lower monthly price than the initial Challenge cost. The membership gives you continued access to coaching, new curriculum, and the community.

**What timezones do you cover?**
With 11 live classes per week and coaches across different timezones, Oracle Boxing serves members worldwide. The coaching schedule covers mornings, afternoons, and evenings across major timezone regions.

**How is this different from YouTube boxing tutorials?**
YouTube videos are one-way — you watch, but no one watches you. Oracle Boxing provides live, interactive coaching with personalised feedback on YOUR technique. Coaches identify and correct YOUR specific issues, which is impossible with pre-recorded content.

**What are the 3 Pillars of Boxing?**
Stance (how you stand and move), Shape (how you hold your guard and throw punches), and Rotation (how you generate power through hip and shoulder movement). These are the foundations everything else in boxing builds upon.
