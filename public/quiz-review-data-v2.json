This bit of rotation can turn my body through nearly 180 degrees to line up my cross.' Each punch naturally flows into the next when you maintain this rotational axis.",

    "context": "",
    "explanation": "Balance comes from how you plant your feet. Oliver uses the analogy: 'Boxing as though your feet are stuck in mud. If your feet are stuck in mud, no matter how hard or how much power or speed you put into a punch, you're not going to fall off balance because your feet are fixed to the ground.' The key is to push backwards with your front foot and forwards with your back foot simultaneously, creating opposing forces that keep you stable.",

    "context": "",
    "explanation": "When weight is too far forward, your head moves into danger. As Oliver explains: 'It's very easy to be front foot dominant like this, leaning over that front foot, getting your head in range where it can get smacked around.' The solution is to get your weight back while using proper rotation to still reach the same distance. Your head stays safe, but your punches can still land.",

    "context": "",
    "explanation": "Oliver explains the anatomy: 'If you didn't know, your muscles move your skeleton. When we're punching, it wouldn't be advantageous to tense my bicep because it's doing the opposing contraction - it's gonna be harder for me to extend my arm.' Tension before a punch acts like a brake. You need relaxation UNTIL the moment of impact, then you tense to create a solid connection. It's 'relaxation to tension, not tension to relaxation.'",
